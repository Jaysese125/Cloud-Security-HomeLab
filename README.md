(COMPLETED)             (COMPLETED)              (NEXT STEP)            (FUTURE STEP)          (FUTURE STEP)

PHASE 1: LOCAL LINUX SERVER DEPLOYMENT & BASELINE HARDENING

Status: 100% COMPLETE & VERIFIED
Host Machine: JayPC (AMD Ryzen 3 3200G, 16GB RAM)
Hypervisor: Oracle VirtualBox
Guest OS: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (Headless Setup)
Dedicated Management IP: 192.168.1.200

Project Milestones Achieved:
* Hardware Virtualization Configuration: Enabled SVM Mode in the AMD BIOS to unlock hypervisor capabilities on the host system.
* Resource Allocation: Provisioned a balanced, headless guest instance utilizing 2 vCPU Cores and 2GB RAM.
* Layer 2 Networking Architecture: Configured the VirtualBox network interface card to Bridged Mode to seamlessly attach the server to the physical home subnet.

* Perimeter Hardening: Deployed Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) enforcing a default-deny inbound posture.
* Network Whitelisting: Migrated the perimeter access rule from a globally exposed network configuration to a targeted local subnet mask whitelist (192.168.1.0/24), neutralizing unauthorized access vectors.
* Static IP Orchestration: Overrode the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) by injecting a permanent static routing table profile via Netplan configuration.

PHASE 2: MANUAL LOG ANALYSIS & ACTIVE INTRUSION PREVENTION (IPS)

Status: 100% COMPLETE & VERIFIED
Core Software Engine: Nginx Web Server Ecosystem
IPS Daemon: Fail2Ban System Automation

Project Milestones Achieved:
* Forensic Log Parsing Infrastructure: Developed multi-column parsing pipelines using Linux data manipulation tools to inspect real-time application access telemetry.
* Pattern Discovery: Isolated automated directory discovery brute-force signatures by mapping network communication behaviors to specific internal server resources.
* Automated Threat Suppression: Implemented a custom regular expression filter linked to a dynamic Fail2Ban jail policy to automatically manipulate the host firewall state upon threat detection.
* Perimeter Policy Hardening: Configured strict, unnegotiated packet dropping mechanisms to fully neutralize active network scanners.

DEEP-DIVE: PHASE 2 INCIDENT ANALYSIS & TELEMETRY

1. Forensic Log Parsing (The Command-Line Pipeline)
To isolate unauthorized scanning behavior, specific text manipulation pipelines were executed directly against the live Nginx access log (/var/log/nginx/access.log):

* Source Isolation (Tracking Hit Volume per Host):
  sudo awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

* URI Intent Analysis (Tracking Targeted Directory Paths):
  sudo awk '{print $7}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

* The Cross-Reference Matrix (Tying Unique Hosts to Action Profiles):
  sudo awk '{print $1, $7}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

Analytical Findings:
The output explicitly mapped out two distinct operational profiles across the local network fabric:
1. 192.168.1.41 (Mobile Endpoint): Valid user behavior interacting exclusively with the site root directory (/).
2. 192.168.1.2 (Windows Endpoint): Aggressive, high-velocity directory traversal scanner hunting for administrative entry points (/wp-login.php, /secret-passwords.txt, /admin), generating a continuous series of HTTP 404 Not Found errors.

2. Automated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Configuration
To programmatically block the malicious profile, an automated active response loop was deployed:

* The Signature Filter (/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf):
  [Definition]
  failregex = ^<HOST> - - \\[.*\\] ".*" 404 .*

* The Enforcement Jail Configuration (/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/nginx-404.local):
  Configured a strict operational policy: If an IP triggers 5 failed resource requests (404) inside a rolling 10-second window, Fail2Ban dynamically modifies the kernel firewall layer to inject a hard network block for a 10-minute duration:
  
  [nginx-404]
  enabled = true
  port    = http,https
  filter  = nginx-404
  logpath = /var/log/nginx/access.log
  backend = auto
  maxretry = 5
  findtime = 10
  bantime  = 600
  action   = ufw[action=deny]

PHASE 3: NETWORK RECONNAISSANCE & PERIMETER AUDITING (NMAP)

Status: SLATED FOR EXECUTION (Next Step)
Core Tooling: Nmap Engine (Network Mapper)

Project Objectives:
* Threat Modeling: Conduct aggressive stealth TCP Syn scans (`nmap -sS -p- -A`) from client environments to map open ports and evaluate edge exposure.
* Validation Vector: Verify firewall efficacy by proving that unwhitelisted targets see the server as completely filtered (invisible) while whitelist clients can communicate transparently.

PHASE 4: NETWORK PACKET FORENSICS & TRAFFIC ANALYSIS (WIRESHARK)

Status: SLATED FOR EXECUTION
Core Tooling: Wireshark Protocol Analyzer

Project Objectives:
* Handshake Dissection: Capture live packet frames over the Bridged interface to inspect raw 3-Way TCP handshakes (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
* Threat Signature Mapping: Inspect network packet flags and raw hex bytes during simulated scanning loops to analyze attack patterns before they hit log files.

PHASE 5: DISTRIBUTED ENTERPRISE SIEM DATA ANALYTICS (SPLUNK)

Status: SLATED FOR EXECUTION
Core Tooling: Splunk Enterprise Core / Universal Forwarder Architecture

Project Objectives:
* Centralized Aggregation: Spin up a secondary Virtual Machine running Splunk Enterprise to act as a centralized Security Operations Center (SOC) hub.
* Forwarder Provisioning: Deploy lightweight Splunk Universal Forwarders to pipeline `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/fail2ban.log` securely to the indexer.
* Dashboard Engineering: Write custom Splunk Processing Language (SPL) searches to build live dashboard visualizations mapping geo-IP intelligence and firewall drop counts.

ENGINEERING PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED, TROUBLESHOOTING & INCIDENT LOGS

1. Problem Encountered: VirtualBox Installation Blocking (Missing Dependencies)
   * Symptom: VirtualBox installer warned about missing core packages regarding Python and pywin32 components.
   * Resolution: Installed Python runtime environment and executed "pip install pywin32" on the Windows host machine before running the installer again.

2. Problem Encountered: Hypervisor Partition Failure (VERR_SVM_DISABLED)
   * Symptom: VirtualBox threw an execution block code E_FAIL (0x80004005).
   * Resolution: Rebooted JayPC, entered the BIOS menu via the Delete key, navigated to Advanced CPU Configuration, and toggled SVM Mode to Enabled.

3. Problem Encountered: Ubuntu Server Installation Long Loading / Hang
   * Symptom: The operating system installation screen remained stuck during package fetching.
   * Resolution: Increased the VM hardware allocation to 2 vCPU Cores and 2GB RAM to handle the compilation overhead over the Bridged network adapter.

4. Problem Encountered: Managing Open Access Risk vs Perimeter Lockdown
   * Symptom: Initial firewall rule allowing port 22 exposed the SSH login interface globally to any local node connected across the Wi-Fi extender or network subnet.
   * Resolution: Cleared global inbound rules (sudo ufw delete 1) and provisioned discrete IP-matching access vectors using the dedicated interface addresses of the management computers.

5. Problem Encountered: Administrative Lockout via Client DHCP Lease Rotation
   * Symptom: Client management machines (MacBook and Windows PC) were abruptly blocked from SSH access after the local home router dynamically rotated their IP assignments, invalidating the firewall's strict single-IP whitelist.
   * Resolution: Accessed the core hypervisor console directly and expanded the network perimeter rule from a single host IP structure to a local subnet mask configuration:
     "sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp"
     This maintains strict external blocking while allowing dynamic internal management mobility.

6. Problem Encountered: Router Admin Dashboard Lockout (Unknown Credentials)
   * Symptom: Attempted to configure permanent DHCP IP Reservations via the default gateway (192.168.1.1), but was entirely blocked due to unconfigured/unknown router administrative login credentials.
   * Resolution: Pivoted away from perimeter infrastructure modifications and shifted focus toward a host-based remediation strategy managed directly within the server OS.

7. Problem Encountered: Server IP Rotation on System Restart
   * Symptom: Every time the Ubuntu server instance rebooted, the home router assigned it a different dynamic IP address (e.g., shuffling from 192.168.1.39), requiring manual console checks (ip a) before clients could establish an SSH session.
   * Resolution: Decoupled the server from the router's dynamic pool by rewriting the network configuration file (/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml) to inject a persistent, static IP binding at 192.168.1.200/24.

8. Problem Encountered: Netplan Configuration Exposure Vulnerability
   * Symptom: Executing network configuration updates via "sudo netplan try" threw security warnings stating permissions for the Netplan configuration file were too open and accessible by non-admin users.
   * Resolution: Hardcoded strict file-system security by modifying the file permissions to read/write exclusively for the root system administrator using the command "sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml".

9. Problem Encountered: SSH Host Identification Fingerprint Mismatch
   * Symptom: After applying the static IP transition, client machines blocked connection attempts with a critical security alert: "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!".
   * Resolution: Cleared the outdated cryptographic keys mapped to the target IP address in the local machine records by executing "ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.200" (and 192.168.1.39) on the client terminals, forcing a clean, authenticated key re-exchange.

10. Problem Encountered: Active Bypass of Active Firewall Ban Entries
    * Symptom: Even after the automated system successfully verified an attack signature and injected an active REJECT IN firewall rule into UFW, the browser on the client machine could still reload and retrieve valid 404 pages instead of being blocked.
    * Resolution: Isolated the root cause to TCP Keep-Alive Session Persistence. The browser was pushing traffic through a persistent communication socket that was established before the firewall rule took effect, bypassing input filters. Resolved by manually triggering the socket statistics utility to explicitly sever the open TCP connection state pool: "sudo ss -K dst 192.168.1.2".

11. Problem Encountered: Persistence of Application Error Screens Post-Ban
    * Symptom: When modifying the system to deploy an absolute package suppression rule (action = ufw[action=deny]), the client test machine continued to display the immediate Nginx 404 Not Found screen rather than spinning into a standard network connection error timeout.
    * Resolution: Isolated the root cause to Client-Side Browser Caching. The browser pulled the static 404 error page elements straight out of local disk storage instead of requesting fresh frames over the network wire. Resolved by running automated validation scripts inside an Incognito Environment, suppressing localized disk memory and forcing raw wire frames that were successfully dropped by UFW, showing the verified ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT screen.

12. Problem Encountered: Authentication Failures via HTTPS Git Token Operations
    * Symptom: Attempts to run "git push" over the standard HTTPS remote protocol yielded "remote: Invalid username or token / fatal: Authentication failed" errors due to strict personal access token syntax errors or token cache expiration constraints.
    * Resolution: Completely decoupled the repository from HTTPS operations by generating an asymmetric Ed25519 SSH Key Pair ("ssh-keygen -t ed25519") on the host system, binding the public signature key directly to GitHub's account engine, and pivoting the repository remote mapping array over to the secure SSH routing architecture ("git remote add origin git@github.com:Jaysese125/Active-Defense-Ubuntu-Lab.git"). This permanently bypasses plain text prompt restrictions.

13. Problem Encountered: Pushed Commits Failing to Register on GitHub Contribution Dashboard
    * Symptom: Code modifications and project completions were successfully accepted by the remote repository endpoint, but failed to log metrics or trigger activity status changes on the primary user account history timeline.
    * Resolution: Traced the behavior to a localized cryptographic identification syntax error where the local shell identity parameter ("git config user.email") contained a character typo, mismatching the verified profile address. Reconfigured the server runtime engine utilizing "git config --global user.email "your_actual_email@example.com"" to precisely align network transport identities with target accounting profiles, establishing seamless metric syncing.

14. Problem Encountered: Git Push Rejection via Out-of-Sync Remote Timeline (fetch first)
    * Symptom: Executing "git push" threw a critical error: "! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first) / error: failed to push some refs", indicating the remote GitHub repository contained commit tracking states missing from the local server's database.
    * Resolution: Synchronized the divergent branches by pulling the remote state down and forcing a local non-rebase merge event using "git pull origin main --no-rebase". Resolved the automatic commit message prompt within the system text editor, successfully unifying the remote and local file histories before executing a clean upstream deployment ("git push origin main").
